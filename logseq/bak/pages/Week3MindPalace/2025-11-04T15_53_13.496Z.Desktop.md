## 🏰 Overview: “The Scrum Castle”

Imagine walking through a **castle dedicated to Scrum and Software Quality**.

Each **room** or **hall** represents a major concept, and within each, **objects and scenes** encode specific ideas.

Let’s design your palace from the outside in:

---
- ### 🏰 1. Castle Gates —  *Agile and Scrum*
- **Big stone archway** engraved “Agile” – flexible, adaptive.
- Inside the gate: a **rugby scrum statue** — represents *Scrum, a version of Agile*.
- Next to it, a **waterfall fountain** vs **small sprint track** — contrasts *Waterfall* (delayed learning) and *Scrum* (early feedback).
  
  ---
- ### 🏠 2. Entrance Hall —  *Scrum Terms*
  
  Each item in the hall represents a key Scrum term:
- **Goal** – A flag at the end of the hall.
- **Sprint** – A running track (1-month loop).
- **Planning Table** – Covered with post-its (“to-do” items).
- **Product Sculpture** – A model of software.
- **Backlog Shelf** – Work items stacked by priority.
- **Team Portrait** – ≤10 people, same size, no hierarchy.
- **Scrum Master Statue** – Holds a whistle and book (“Rules”).
- **Daily Scrum Clock** – Set to 15 minutes.
- **Increment Brick** – Each brick = a sprint’s result.
- **“Done” Plaque** – Polished gold (finished work).
- **“Not Done” Dusty Stone** – Unpolished (unfinished).
- **Review Stage** – Where sprints are inspected.
- **Introspective Mirror** – Symbol of reflection and improvement.
  
  ---
- ### ⚙️ 3. Great Hall of Roles —  *Scrum Teams*
  
  Three thrones:
- **Scrum Master** – Holds a whistle (coach), broom (removes obstacles), and open rulebook.
- **Product Owner** – Has scrolls (backlog), keys (funding), telescope (vision).
- **Developers** – Workbench with pair-programming terminals and “Definition of Done” plaque.
  
  In the rafters: **Chickens and Pigs** statues 🐔🐖 — symbolizing commitment levels.
  
  ---
- ### 📜 4. Artifact Chamber —  *Scrum Artifacts and Commitments*
  
  Three pedestals:
- **Product Backlog Scroll** – Emergent, ordered list. Above it, a glowing **Product Goal Crystal** (future state).
- **Sprint Backlog Tablet** – Tasks etched for the current sprint, guarded by a **Sprint Goal Banner** (single objective).
- **Increment Brick Wall** – Every brick = a completed increment, forming the product.
  
  ---
- ### ⏳ 5. Clock Room —  *Scrum Events*
  
  Circular room with four gears:
- **Sprint Wheel** – The main cycle.
- **Planning Cog** – Starts the motion.
- **Daily Scrum Dial** – 15-minute ticking metronome.
- **Review & Retrospective Dials** – Inspect & adapt.
  
  Plaque reads:
  
  > 
  
  “All meetings live within the Sprint.”
  
  ---
- ### 🧭 6. Rule Chamber —  *Scrum Governance*
  
  In the center:
- **Scrum Master Judge’s Chair** – rule enforcer.
- Around it: scrolls labeled “Team Rules,” “Retrospective Changes.”
- Quote carved in stone:
  
  > 
  
  “Rules come from the team, finalized by the Scrum Master.”
  
  ---
- ### 🌄 7. Vision Garden —  *How Scrum Flow Starts*
  
  A fountain labeled “Project Vision.”
  
  Beside it, the **Product Owner** grows a **tree of backlog items**, fruits tagged with priorities.
  
  Each fruit = *functional* or *non-functional requirement*.
  
  ---
- ### 🏃 8. Sprint Arena —  *Sprint Mechanics*
  
  Circular track:
- Product backlog (start line).
- Sprint backlog (lane markers).
- Daily scrums (small checkpoints).
- Finish line = Increment (potentially shippable).
  
  Around the arena are banners with:
- “1 month max.”
- “Sprint planning meeting < 1 day.”
- “Frozen backlog.”
- “Team self-managing.”
  
  ---
- ### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 9. Sprint Planning Chamber
  
  Long table surrounded by:
- **Product Owner**, **Scrum Team**, **Scrum Master**, **Customers**, **Managers**.
  
  Two halves of the room:
- **Left side** – Product backlog selection (scrolls chosen).
- **Right side** – Sprint backlog construction (sticky notes placed).
  
  Each phase etched above doors:
- “What can we do?” → “How will we do it?”
  
  ---
- ### ⏱️ 10. Daily Scrum Circle
  
  A small circular room:
- Three glowing questions hover:
	- What did you do yesterday?
	- What will you do today?
	- What stands in your way?
	  
	  Chickens sit silently on benches. 🐔
	  
	  Scrum Master with stopwatch ensures 15 minutes max.
	  
	  ---
- ### 🧩 11. Quality Wing —  *Functional & Non-functional Metrics*
  
  Split corridor:
- **Left (Functional Room):** performance machines, secure vault, reliable clock, friendly UI display, safety gear.
- **Right (Non-functional Room):** scalable balloon, portable suitcase, modular Lego wall, interoperable plugs.
  
  At the end, the **ISO 25010 Standard Book** sits on a pedestal.
  
  ---
- ### 💎 12. Quality of Information Vault
  
  Three glowing gems:
- **Accuracy Gem** – shines when complete & correct.
- **Usability Gem** – glows brighter when legible & relevant.
- **Security Gem** – protected by ethical locks.
  
  ---
- ### 🧪 13. QA/QC Laboratory
  
  Two halves:
- **Left (Quality Control):** chaotic test tubes (reactive testing).
- **Right (Quality Assurance):** orderly audit scrolls and certification stamps.
  
  A spiral staircase labeled with the 5 QA levels:
- Initial
- Managed
- Defined
- Measured
- Optimized
  
  ---
- ### 🧠 14. Design Hall —  *SOLID Principles*
  
  Five marble pillars, each inscribed with one principle:
- **Single Responsibility** – One plaque per reason to change.
- **Open/Closed** – Door open for extensions, wall sealed for modifications.
- **Liskov Substitution** – Family portraits of parent & child classes that behave identically.
- **Interface Segregation** – Shattered giant interface into smaller ones.
- **Dependency Inversion** – Pyramid upside down (abstractions on top).
  
  ---
- ### 🧩 15. Pattern Gallery —  *Design Patterns*
  
  Walls lined with paintings and models:
- **Factory** – Machines producing various objects.
- **Singleton** – One glowing orb, guarded.
- **Adapter** – Plug adapters connecting mismatched devices.
- **Bridge** – Rope bridge between interfaces.
- **Decorator** – Jackets layered on mannequins.
- **Facade** – Ticket counter between customer and complex machinery.
- **Composite** – Tree sculpture of grouped items.
- **Flyweight** – Many butterflies sharing one wing pattern.
- **Proxy** – Cache chest before a slow vault.
- **Chain of Responsibility** – Scroll passed between guards.
- **Command** – Buttons triggering soldiers’ moves.
- **Iterator** – Footprints around a loop.
- **Memento** – Frozen time hourglass.
- **Observer** – Bells ring when center statue moves.
- **State** – Chameleon statue changing color.
- **Template** – Blueprint scroll missing fine details.

- ## 🧭 How to Use the Memory Palace
- **Walk through mentally** from the gate inward.
- **Pause** in each room and visualize the symbols.
- **Recall** what each symbol means (e.g., the “bridge” = Bridge Pattern).
- Use **spatial recall** to group related ideas (Scrum, QA, SOLID, Patterns).
