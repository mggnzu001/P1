## Front Door — Categories: Project vs Process
- Visual: a split doorway, left painted green (Process), right painted blue (Project).
- Key contrasts (left = Process, right = Project):
	- **Nature:** routine — ad hoc
	- **Duration:** continuous — fixed start+end
	- **Input/outputs/tasks:** well‑documented — unknown
	- **Success:** >99% — ≈50%
	- **Emphasis:** small improvements — created from scratch
	- **Control:** fixed measurements — outcome/desires
	- **Measurement:** efficiency/cost — meeting requirements/desires

- ## Living Room — Project Considerations & Brooks’ Problems
- Visual: sofa with three cushions labelled Dependencies, Skills, Sequence.
- Systems development requires careful management because of:
	- Dependencies on other software
	- Specific skillsets + milestones
	- Activities that must follow a sequence
- Brooks: types of problems
	- **Essential problems:** caused by requirements, scope (complexity is the core)
	- **Accidental problems:** caused by process, tools, people
	- **Inefficiency sources:** overly complex solutions, faulty simple solutions, complex faulty solutions

	- Loose coupling
	- Clean interfaces
- Prevent accidental complexity from evolving:
	- Use appropriate tools and frameworks
- Guiding principle: managing complexity is primary

- ## Upper Corridor — Five Levels of Design (overview)
- Visual: five doors ascending a staircase (Project → Subsystems → Classes/Packages → Methods/Data → Source code)
- ### Door 1: Project (Design Level 1)
- Visual: blueprint pinned to door.
- Items:
	- Requirements, Scope, Feasibility, Architecture
	- Fulfil requirements: functions/features, I/O, presented content, performance/constraints/interfaces/reliability
	- Scope definitions: narrative descriptions, use cases
	- Goals derived from stakeholder needs; prioritise true needs
	- Feasibility: people, hardware, tools, reusable components
	- Explicit requirements reduce risk and cost
	- Requirement checklists:
		- **Functional:** inputs, outputs, file formats, interfaces, user tasks/UI, data flows
		- **Quality:** response time, performance, security, reliability, resources, maintainability
		- **Completeness:** document changes, fulfill requirements, feasibility
		- **Correctness:** language/syntax, conflicts, tradeoffs, documentation, testable, adaptable
- Architecture components: language, subsystems, classes, data design, business rules, UIs, resources, security, performance, scalability, I/O, error processing, frameworks
- ### Door 2: Subsystems
- Visual: a directory of self‑contained modules.
- Plan subsystems as self‑contained units assignable to people; watch frameworks and interactions (fan‑out concerns).
- ### Door 3: Classes / Packages
- Visual: labeled file boxes for classes.
- Consider: object operations, interactions, publicity, public interfaces.
- ### Door 4: Methods / Data
- Visual: a worksheet split into OOP (methods) vs DOD (data).
- Design questions: what can be done to each object, interactions, interfaces.
- ### Door 5: Source Code
- Visual: terminal with checklist.
- Considerations: requirements, naming conventions, documentation, patterns, parameters, design assertions (pre/post), implementation

- ## Kitchen — SMART Goals & Deliverables
- Visual: recipe card pinned to fridge.
- SMART: Specific, Measurable, Agreed upon, Realistic, Time‑bound
- Deliverable conditions: verifiable/specific, stakeholder‑approved, due time, quality standards
- Schedules decided by effort, resources, deliverables; if unrealistic — delay, add resources, or reduce scope
  
  ---
- ## Dining Table — Mythical Man‑Month & Supporting Plans
- Visual: a half‑set table (missing people).
- Myth: adding people doesn’t always shorten schedules — overhead, training, communication
- Supporting plans:
	- **Human resources plan:** key staff, numbers, skills
	- **Communications plan:** who, how, frequency, method
	- **Risk management plan:** Accept (A), Reduce (R), Transfer (T), Avoid (A)

- ## Office — Five Project Management Activities & Roles
- Visual: whiteboard with five columns and role icons.
- 5 Ps: People, Price, Product, Process, Project
- Roles: Project Manager, Systems Analyst, UI Designer, Architect, Specialists, Documentation

- ## Conference Room — Individual vs Team Success
- Visual: nameplates around table.
- Individual: interest, experience
- Team: communication, group interaction, management skills
  
  ---
- ## Workshop — Activities, Milestones, Deliverables; Software Metrics
- Visual: pegboard with task cards.
- Activity parts: duration, due date, precursor
- Milestone: recognisable end product, formal measurable output
- Deliverable: result for customer; difference: deliverable = outcome, milestone = completion marker
- Why metrics: estimate resources, measure project (cost/duration) and application (size/complexity)
- SMART metric examples: counts, percentages, sums, averages, ratios
- Metric types: process, product, result/control, predictor
- OO metrics: ability to absorb change (concrete classes vs none), application size (use cases, domain classes), class size (attributes, operations, operation size)

- ## Planning Room — Scheduling, Kanban, Network Analysis
- Visual: planning board and Gantt/Network sketches.
- Scheduling activities: split tasks, assign team, estimate time/effort
- Non‑agile schedule steps: identify activities, dependencies, resources, allocate people, create charts
- Kanban lanes: Stories/backlog, ToDo, In Progress, Testing, Done
- Network analysis components: ES/EF, LS/LF, critical path, slack/float
- Six steps of network analysis: label tasks, forward pass, backward pass, total float, free float, find critical path
- CPM limits: assumes exact times, ignores human factors (task switching, Parkinson’s, communication)
- CCPM: adds resource dependencies, uncertainty, buffers (project, feeding, resource)
	- Feeding chain: paths feeding critical path
	- Feeding buffer: cushions critical path between chain end and entry
	- Resource buffer: warns a resource is needed
- CCPM steps: identify tasks, optimistic/pessimistic estimates, create buffers, assign resources (use optimistic), find critical chain, execution (unchanged planned schedule), monitor buffers

- ## Risk Alcove — Risk Management
- Visual: hazard symbols with a tiered list.
- Why manage risk: uncertainty, anticipation
- How: identify, analyse, rank
- Dimensions: probability × cost
- Top risks (summary): personnel shortfalls, unrealistic schedules/budgets, wrong functions/interfaces, gold plating, changing requirements, external reliance, performance shortfalls, infeasible solutions, competition, interruptions
- Consequences: timeline, cost, feasibility, quality
- Risk analysis steps: perception, analysis, strategy, monitor, manage

- ## Attic — Software Triangle, Features, Entropy, Human Factors
- Visual: triangular stained glass (Cheap / Good / Fast).
- Software triangle: choose two among cheap, good, fast
- Feature policy: prevent speculative development (gold plating); ROI diminishes as features add cost
- Software entropy: code disorder (increasing complexity)
- Human factors: pointless work, procrastination, gold plating, task switching
- Methodology risks:
	- Agile: risk of too little preparation — fix: allocate time to design
	- Waterfall: requires near‑perfect preparation — fix: apply experience; often ineffective because software changes and redesigns are common
- Wicked problem: unknown unknown — requires iterative/experimental approach
  
  ---
- ## Basement — Iterative Development, Prototyping, RAD
- Visual: prototype models on shelves.
- Benefits of iterative: lightweight, parallel prototyping, designed for change
- Prototyping cycle: requirements → prototype → test
- RAD: requirements → design → develop → deploy → learn
- Iterative cycle: plan → develop → prototype → feedback → develop
- Iterative vs Waterfall: frequent releases, close teams/clients, hands‑on, expert teams, direct testing, reduced risk, earlier value
